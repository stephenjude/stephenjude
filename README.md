### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Jude](https://stephenjude.me), open-source maintainer and the CTO of [Pay4Me](https://pay4me.app/) where I build and maintain both external and internal APIs while managing the engineering team.

In my free time I've built and maintained various open-source projects of my own like:

- [Wallet](https://github.com/stephenjude/laravel-wallet) - A simple wallet implementation for Laravel.
- [Payment Gateways](https://github.com/stephenjude/laravel-payment-gateways) - A simple Laravel implementation for all payment providers.
- [BlocHQ Bank SDK Gateways](https://github.com/stephenjude/blochq-php-sdk) - An SDK to easily work with the BlocHQ API.
- [SendPortal SDK](https://github.com/stephenjude/laravel-sendportal) - The unofficial Laravel Package to work with the SendPortal APIs.
- [Filament Blog Builder](https://github.com/stephenjude/filament-blog) - A faceless blog content manager with configurable richtext and markdown support for filament admin panel.
- [Filament Debugger](https://github.com/stephenjude/filament-debugger) - Easily add Laravel Telescope and Horizon to Filament admin panel.
- [Extended Artisan Commands](https://github.com/stephenjude/extended-artisan-commands) - Generate plain PHP classes, traits and interfaces using artisan console commands.
- [Api Test Helper](https://github.com/stephenjude/api-test-helper) - A collection of helper methods for testing and debugging API endpoints.
- [Breeze Api](https://github.com/stephenjude/breeze-api) - Minimal Laravel API authentication scaffolding with Sanctum

- [Paystacklite](https://github.com/stephenjude/paystack-lite) - The Fastest Way To Setup Paystack Checkout Form In Your Laravel Application.
- [Lite Blog](https://github.com/stephenjude/lite-blog) - A Laravel blog generator.

I also run a [local laravel community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/E8JlxxKj9cECSihKA92fgG) here in Nigeria. Occasionally, I also speak at conferences and user groups. And I also blog from time to time about various things on [my website](https://stephenjude.me).

Working on open-source is the easiest way I payback for the free things I have been using and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possibly can. Thanks for visiting!
