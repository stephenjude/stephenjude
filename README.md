### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Jude](https://stephenjude.me), open-source maintainer and one of the core team members of [Across The Horizon Technologies](https://athtgroup.com/) where I build and maintain both external and internal APIs. I also do take on the CTO roles and responsibilities.

In my free time I've built and maintain various open-source projects of my own like:

- [Extended Artisan Commands](https://github.com/stephenjude/extended-artisan-commands) - Generate plain PHP classes, traits and interfaces using artisan console commands.
- [Lite Blog](https://github.com/stephenjude/lite-blog) - A Laravel blog generator.
- [Api Test Helper](https://github.com/stephenjude/api-test-helper) - A collection of helper methods for testing and debugging API endpoints.
- [Breeze Api](https://github.com/stephenjude/breeze-api) - Minimal Laravel API authentication scaffolding with Sanctum
- [Default Model Sorting](https://github.com/stephenjude/default-model-sorting) - Add custom default sorting column to your eloquent model.
- [Simple Query Filter](https://github.com/stephenjude/simple-query-filter) - Filter Eloquent ORM queries based on HTTP request.

I also run a [local laravel community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/E8JlxxKj9cECSihKA92fgG) here in Nigeria. Occasionally, I also speak at conferences and user groups. And I also blog from time to time about various things on [my website](https://stephenjude.com).

Working on open-source is the eaisest way I payback for the free things I have been using and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. Thanks for visiting!
