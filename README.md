### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Jude](https://stephenjude.me), open-source maintainer and the CTO of [Pay4Me](https://pay4me.app/) where I build and maintain both external and internal APIs while managing the engineering team.

In my free time I've built and maintained various open-source projects of my own like. Occasionally, I also speak at conferences and user groups. And I also blog from time to time about various things on [my website](https://stephenjude.me).
