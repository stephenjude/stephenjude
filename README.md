### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Jude](https://stephenjude.me), open-source maintainer and the CTO of [Pay4Me](https://pay4me.app/) where I build and maintain both external and internal APIs while managing the engineering team.

In my free time I've built and maintained various open-source projects of my own like.

I also run a [local laravel community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/E8JlxxKj9cECSihKA92fgG) here in Nigeria. Occasionally, I also speak at conferences and user groups. And I also blog from time to time about various things on [my website](https://stephenjude.me).

Working on open-source is the easiest way I payback for the free things I have been using and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possibly can. Thanks for visiting!
